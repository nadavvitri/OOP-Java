#File Description
SimpleHashSet.java - The basic class for hash sets. an abstract class implementing SimpleSet.
OpenHashSet.java - class that represent the open hash set (each cell in the hash table is a reference
to a MyLinkedList).
ClosedHashSet.java - class that represent the close hash set (each cell in the hash table is a reference
to a String).
CollectionFacadeSet.java - Wraps an underlying Collection.
MyLinkedList.java - Define a wrapper-class that has-a LinkedList.
SimpleSetPerformanceAnalyzer.java - This class has a main method that measures and compare the run-times and
performance of many types of collection.

#Design
In my point of view there is a basic methods that basic to all of kind of hash set - the add, remove, contain
and rehashing common to any kind of hash set, but there implementation are different (cause every hash has a
different type of object's in cells and each acr differently when there is a collision). so I decided to
make SimpleHashSet abstract (that implement SimpleSet) so the common method's of his "sons" (Open and Closed
hash set) will be abstract and implement differently in each hash set.

#Implementation Issues
* OpenHashSet - first I build a class of MyLinkedList and insert to every cell object from her.
Obliviously I used the simple method contain to check if value in or not in the set and then add or remove
the value from the set. In addition, before the operations delete and add I first check if rehashing is
necessary. I write a function rehashing the get a param of int that tell me if I need to increas or decrease
the hash table - in my opinion it's simplify to increase or decrease in the same function just by getting
"flag" the represent what we need to do.
* ClosedHashSet - the main "problem" of this class is deletion - I find more easily and more efficient to
 delete by insert empty string there. In that i cand find value just by runnig over the set until I get null.
 (if I just insert in a null there can be a problem when we add and remove some value and there trying to add
 it's again after we change the capacity of the table..).
