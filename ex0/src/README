#File Description
KnessetMember.java - contain the Knesset member class.
Law.java - contain the Law class.
Assembly.java - contain the Assembly class.


#Design
Each class contain the method's and the characterises of law/knesset member/assembly.
In Assembly class i create also array of laws per knesset member (that represent the number of laws the
MK support), and then i can check if MK can support laws or he reach the max number of laws he can support.

#Implementation Issues
lawsPerKnessetMember in Assembly class - there many ways to check if MK reach the max number of laws he can
support. I think that create array parallel to the knesset member is the simple way.
