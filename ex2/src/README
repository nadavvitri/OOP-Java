#Design
The basic class for basic Space Ship represent in SpaceShip class. I use the abstract class and super method.
In my design of the program there is things that basic for every ship buy there some changes between them -
like the image represent the ship. The basic methods that need to be implement in little difference between
each ships wrote like abstract method - the doAction, and the getImage, and the constructor of ship.
In specific SpaceShip I use the super in the constructor and if necessary i add some other features (like
counter for trying teleport and so on). In the same way I add some changes in the doAction and getImage.
In my opinion this is more readable and easy to understand, and these method really common to all SpaceShips.
In addition I try to simplify the code by writing function in the SpaceShip class that used several times in
other space ship classes - like the ChargingEnergy that we need to charge every round, and the
distanceFromCloseShip method that calculate the distance between close space ship and the angleFromCloseShip
that calculate the angle to the close space ship. This save "lines of code" and prevent recycling of the same
code.

#Implementation Issues
Drunkard space ship - I decided to implement the drunken pilot like a really pilot that drink to much, and
act in different behave by randomly. for that I use the random (boolean and int for move).
every 20 rounds the pilot try to teleport, every 10 rounds the pilot try to fire and every 5 rounds the
pilot try to put shield on.
Special space ship - I decided to implement the special pilot to act like a "leech" but for fun every 100
rounds he randomly try to teleport (by using random boolean that several times he will teleport)
