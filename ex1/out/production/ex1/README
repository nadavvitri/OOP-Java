#Design
Each class contain the method's and the characterises.
the Human player has some different. The "strings" we need to print to the user are in the competition class,
but if the user make a illegal move or unsupported key we handle this in the Player class.

#Implementation Issues
Smart player - there are many ways to implement the smart player. I choose to check every turn the numbers
of the unmarked sticks at the board. if this number is even the smart player mark only one (to put his
opponent with one stick and lose the game!). if this number is odd from the same reason the smart player
mark  sticks.
there is also option that the number of the unmarked stick is odd but we can't mark 2 sticks (for example
only one stick unmarked in every row) and in this situation the smart player lose the game and i implement
this that the smart player chose a random move.
